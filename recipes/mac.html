        <p>
            There's a reason that in the 90 years since its invention, the Caesar salad has become the default second salad option at every single major restaurant chain in the country. We all know what it is: chopped romaine lettuce and garlicky croutons, tossed in a creamy dressing made with eggs, olive oil, lemon, Parmesan, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies. Even when mass-produced, this combination of savory, creamy, tangy, and crunchy ingredients is tasty stuff. But we can do better than those chains in our own kitchens, I hope.

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
